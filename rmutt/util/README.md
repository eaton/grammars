# Rmutt Helper Libraries

A collection of useful utility libraries that other grammars can import.

* html.rm and markdown.rm provide formatting wrappers for a handful of common elements like headings, links, images, and quotations. They use the same rule names, so they can't be imported simultaneously, but they can be swapped out to change a grammar's output formatting.
